# RAG-Anything Test Document

This is a test document to demonstrate RAG-Anything's multimodal processing capabilities.

## Introduction

RAG-Anything is a comprehensive multimodal RAG system that can process various types of content including text, images, tables, and mathematical equations.

## Key Features

1. **Multimodal Processing**: Handles text, images, tables, and equations
2. **MinerU Integration**: Uses MinerU v2.5 for high-fidelity document parsing
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Creates structured representations of content
4. **Intelligent Retrieval**: Advanced search across all content types

## Performance Metrics

| Method | Accuracy | Speed | Memory Usage |
|--------|----------|-------|--------------|
| RAG-Anything | 95.2% | 120ms | 2.1GB |
| Traditional RAG | 87.3% | 180ms | 1.8GB |
| Baseline | 82.1% | 200ms | 1.5GB |

## Mathematical Formula

The relevance probability can be calculated using:

P(d|q) = P(q|d) Ã— P(d) / P(q)

Where:
- P(d|q) is the probability of document d being relevant to query q
- P(q|d) is the probability of query q given document d
- P(d) is the prior probability of document d
- P(q) is the probability of query q

## Conclusion

RAG-Anything provides a unified solution for processing and querying multimodal documents, making it particularly valuable for academic research, technical documentation, and enterprise knowledge management.
